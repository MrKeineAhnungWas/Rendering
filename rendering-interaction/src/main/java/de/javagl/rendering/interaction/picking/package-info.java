 * Interfaces related to picking objects in a 3D environment.

 * The interfaces in this package are abstract descriptions of entities

 * classes that may act as a 
 * {@link de.javagl.rendering.interaction.picking.Picker}, and classes
 * that represent a 
 * {@link de.javagl.rendering.interaction.picking.PickingResult}.
 * Instances of classes implementing these interfaces may be created
 * using the corresponding factory methods.
