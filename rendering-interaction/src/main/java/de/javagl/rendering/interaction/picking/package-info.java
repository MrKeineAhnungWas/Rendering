/**
 * Interfaces related to picking objects in a 3D environment.
 * <p>
 * The interfaces in this package are abstract descriptions
 * of entities that may be picked, classes that may perform
 * picking, and the results of picking processes. Instances
 * of classes implementing these interfaces may be created
 * using the corresponding factory methods of the classes
 * in the implementation package.
